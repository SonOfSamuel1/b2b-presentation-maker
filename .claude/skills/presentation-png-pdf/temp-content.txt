# The Second Coming of Jesus
Hope, Promise, and Eternal Glory

## Biblical Foundation
- Jesus promised: "I will come again and receive you" (John 14:3)
- Angels at His ascension: "This same Jesus will come back" (Acts 1:11)
- Referenced over 300 times in the New Testament alone
- Mentioned in every book except Galatians and Philemon
- The "blessed hope" that anchors and transforms our faith today

## Signs Indicating His Near Return
- Wars, ethnic conflicts, and global unrest increasing (Matthew 24:6-7)
- Natural disasters rising: earthquakes, famines, floods, climate extremes
- Gospel reaching every nation through technology and missions (Matthew 24:14)
- Widespread apostasy and falling away from truth (2 Thessalonians 2:3)
- Israel restored as a nation (1948) and controlling Jerusalem (1967)

## The Rapture: Christ for His Church
- Jesus descends from heaven with a commanding shout (1 Thessalonians 4:16)
- The righteous dead in Christ rise first with glorified bodies
- Living believers instantly transformed and caught up in clouds
- We meet the Lord in the air and remain forever
- Can happen at any moment - no prophesied events required

## The Great Tribulation: Seven Years of Testing
- A seven-year period of unprecedented global judgment and testing
- The Antichrist rises to power, deceiving nations with false peace
- Three series of judgments: seals, trumpets, and bowls of God's wrath
- Two-thirds of Israel will perish, but the remnant will turn to Christ
- This period prepares the earth for Christ's physical reign and kingdom

## The Glorious Appearing: Christ with His Saints
- Jesus returns visibly to earth with His glorified saints and angels
- Every eye will see Him - a public, unmistakable, global appearance
- Defeats the Antichrist and false prophet at Armageddon
- Satan bound in the abyss for 1,000 years, unable to deceive nations

## How Then Should We Live Today?

- Share the gospel with urgency - time is short and souls hang in the balance
- Pursue holiness and purity, knowing we'll give account for our lives
- Watch and pray, staying spiritually alert and not caught off guard
- Encourage one another daily with the hope of His return (1 Thessalonians 4:18)
